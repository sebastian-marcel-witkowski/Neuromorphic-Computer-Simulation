# Neuromorphic-Computer-Simulation
This is the code and final report I submitted for my senior capstone in which I designed and simulated a neuromorphic computer which
utilized the memristor in a crossbar array in order to implement the non-Von Neumann architecture necessary to simulate a neural network.
More details on my research and implementation can be found in the .docx which I've also included.
